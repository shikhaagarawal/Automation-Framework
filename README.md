# Automation-Framework

This framework uses Spring, Apache POI, core java and selenium web driver. Support chrome and IE as of now. But can be extended for any number of browser by adding selenium supported browser executable and adding small amount of code to read respective exe.

Framework will read all test cases marked as 'Y' under RunManager.xlsx.
Code will search for all test cases under TestScripts\<test script name>
